## My Contributions  
As a **Full Stack MERN Developer**, I was responsible for both frontend and backend development, ensuring a seamless experience for users and administrators. On the backend, I built **RESTful APIs** with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, integrated **MongoDB** for efficient database storage, and implemented **JWT authentication** for secure user sessions. I also set up **Stripe payment processing** and Firebase for real-time notifications.  

On the frontend, I developed dynamic **React components** using **Tailwind CSS** and managed application state efficiently with **Redux**. I optimized user flows for ordering and checkout, ensuring smooth navigation and transaction completion. Additionally, I worked on refining the order-tracking system, while my team members contributed to UI/UX enhancements, testing, and deployment. We collaborated via **GitHub**, ensuring efficient version control and smooth integration of new features.
